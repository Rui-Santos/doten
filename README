Project doten.co
Cecil Li and Gilbert Liu

INTRODUCTION
As one of very first bitcoin trading platforms in China, doten.co was created in May 2011. Unfortunately, due to the catastrophic mtgox incident which occurred in July, the website together with its servers was brought down to an end by Aug 2011.

TECHNOLOGY
This project is based on CakePHP 1.3 with MySQL and the official bitcoin client in the backend. This project made full use of the account aspects of the official bitcoin client, which was not very reliable at the time. Although it is not the best practice, we prefer not to change. Edit /app/controllers/components/bitcoin.php to change the settings for anything you want.

DEPLOYMENT
Please follow the instruction at CakePHP official site http://cakephp.org
Notice that the entire /app/config directory is ripped off by the default .gitignore
And don't forget the jsonRPC settings in /app/controllers/components/bitcoin.php to connect to the bitcoin server
Finally, Start the bitcoin client with jsonRPC enabled in the setting file.
Backup your wallet.
